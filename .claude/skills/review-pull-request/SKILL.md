# Review Pull Request

Produces a structured code review by fetching a PR's description and diff via **MCP**.

## How to Use This Skill

1. Resolve the target PR and fetch its diff through MCP.
2. Check requirements conformance before applying sub-skill audits.
3. Load the required sub-skills in full and apply them against the diff.
4. Produce the review report, then optionally post it back via MCP.

## Notes

- Never expose secrets, credentials, or internal environment values found in the diff in the review report — redact them as `[REDACTED]` and flag the finding.
- If the PR description is empty or very sparse, note this in the Summary as a process issue.
- This skill is read-only by default. It does not modify any files unless the user explicitly asks for auto-fixes.
